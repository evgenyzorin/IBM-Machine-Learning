# :rocket: IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate
This repository consists of the 6 Final Projects of the [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) and covers such Machine Learning topics as **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Time Series**.

### Bank Customer Churn Analysis
The main goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis of the bank's credit department data and understand the relationship between the various features. This will allow further building of a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to drop credit card services in order to offer them more compatible and attractive services.

### Airbnb NYC 2019 Price Prediction
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model based on Linear Regression that can predict prices for Airbnb listings in New York City.

### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
The main goal of this project is to try to answer the question, "Which people were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic?" by interpreting features of passenger data that can be used to build the most accurate predictive model based on classification algorithms.
## :file_folder: [Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/evgenyzorin/IBM-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Clustering)
### Mall Customer Segmentation
The main goal of this project is to create an unsupervised learning model using a clustering approach that can identify various customer segments and help the mall marketing team develop an appropriate marketing strategy for each customer segment.

### Intel Image Classification
The main goal of this project is to create a classification model based on a Convolutional Neural Network that can identify what type of natural scene an image can be classified as.
## :file_folder: [Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis](https://github.com/evgenyzorin/IBM-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Time-Series)
### Air Passengers Prediction
The main goal of this project is to build a model that will be able to predict the demand for air travel (passenger traffic) in the United States for the next 12 months based on data from the past 12 years.
